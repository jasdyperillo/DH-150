## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge
The Co—Star app's purpose is to deepen users' knowledge of their own astrological identity, as well as establish and strengthen their relationships with people in their lives who share their interest in astrology. In regards to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, this purpose or activity speaks to a human's need to feel like they belong and the need to maintain and nurture one's own self-esteem. These are very broad and expansive needs, so it makes sense that there are many different approaches to this. For one, to some extent, one must believe in the ideologies behind astrology in order to be willing to partake and use an app like Co—Star. By that logic, a user on the Co—Star app can only begin to build and/or join a community on the app if they know people who share that belief. Through digital technology, a general category of limitations that this app and its users may face is in regards to accessibility. Questions of how we/Co—Star can make astrology more accessible to those with disabilities arise, but also in a less technical sense, how can we/Co—Star make astrology more accessible to people who aren't inclined to invest their time in astrology.

_How might we improve the design of the Co—Star app so it is engaging and piques the interest of those who are initially closed-off to astrology?_


## Step 02: Target users
From my personal experience, I find that younger generations tend to be more inclined to want to read or hear about astrology and what it might mean for them. As someone who is Generation Z, I feel that a lot of people in my age range and demographic aren't particularly religious, and if they are, they don't tend to be incredibly attached or committed to the ideals, traditions, and/or practices of their religion. That being said, the ideal user/candidate to interview would be someone for whom the latter description applies. 

Like institutional religions, astrology has the duality of both exercising the belief in solitude, as well as in communal settings, but more so with an emphasis on the solitude. There aren't necessarily designated commonplace buildings or spaces where people who believe or share an interest in astrology can gather on a regular basis. Therefore, users of an app like Co—Star are 'insolated' in a sense, aside from the friends they add on the app. While one can visit mediums or astrologists, doing so requires time and money. 

I chose to interview a user I know from personal experience.

## Step 03: Observation/Research Method(s)
I chose to conduct a participatory observation/interview. As previously mentioned, astrology doesn't really coincide with any physical spaces or locations where people gather on a regularly anticipated basis. Thankfully, one of my roommates uses the Co—Star app. He fits the demographic I was seeking to learn more about: a Gen-Z college student who grew up with exposure to an institutionalized religion.
I used the website Otter to record the audio of the interview and transcribe—and later edit—the dialogue and verbal exchange between the participant and I.

### Reflection
While it's important to create a script that will serve as a guide for the interview, I really began to understand the importance of making the interview as conversational as possible. I feel that by doing so, a participant or interviewee will feel more at ease and comfortable with speaking their mind without a concern or feeling conscious about what they will say. Although I would've liked to ask more about the participant's religious background—which wouldn't necessarily be unwarranted considering the app and the fact that I personally know the participant, I felt that this may breach a personal boundary if this were an interview conducted with a real stranger. 
I really loved the website Otter, which was suggested by our professor. The automatic transcription had a pretty high rate of accuracy in transcribing the audio recording, which significantly cut down the time and effort that this assignment demanded from me. 
I didn't anticipate this, but perhaps the most interesting and helpful insight that came from this participatory observation/interview came at the end when I asked the interviewee what tool they would devise or create if they could magically do so. I guess I felt like in this age of advanced technology and digital communication, I find it hard to think of things that haven't been thought of or that I've heard of before. But my participant's answer was truly one-of-a-kind and really encapsulated what the target user ultimately wants. Beyond the participant's actual answers, I learned that it's really powerful to understand the language and word choice a person uses to describe any given thing. I think it really lends itself to the researcher to look into the nuanced perspective of what it's like to be on the other end of the product—an app in this case—which can be hard to lose sight of because of how familiar one becomes with the product/app through each phase of research, user testing, etc.
