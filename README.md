# Co—Star
## DH150 UX Design, Jasdy Perillo

## About the Project
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.
This project involves the mobile app user's user experience design for a community interested in astrology.

## Clear design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
I chose the UCLASafeRide app because I am part of the community who uses the app—the UCLA community. I think it's important that services like UCLA Safe Ride exist because it contributes to the safety and accessibility of life at UCLA for students, faculty, staff, and more. To me, apps like UCLA Safe Ride are crucial because they contribute to the UCLA experience. For example, I can catch a van ride back to my apartment after a late night meeting on campus with my roommates or friends. I can use it to go visit Ralph's where I sometimes do my grocery shopping. This app shapes how I, and many fellow students, experience UCLA, because without it, I might not be able to attend on-campus events at night, given how far I live. The service that UCLA Safe Ride provides is integral to the UCLA community.

I chose the Co—Star app because it's a pioneer in its 'field.' Co—Star was the one of the first apps developed that did more than provide users with information about astrology and their personal birth charts. The app has a feature that lets a person add and message friends who also have an account, which allows users to compare their birth charts and daily horoscopes with those of their friends. Co—Star even provides a compatibility 'diagnostic' that analyzes a user's astrological compatibility with a friend. The Co—Star app makes astrology more accessible and its inherent design and mission is to allow users to foster and strengthen the sense of community that they share with those in their lives.

The Co—Star app provides users with insight into their astrological identity through daily in-depth horoscopes. It also serves as a platform for users to interact with friends by offering compatibility evaluations based on their birth/natal charts.I conducted a usability test using a screen recording of the user's iPhone while they completed the tasks on the app. I also documented the participant by using ActivePresenter, which records a laptop's screen with the audio and visuals of the person using the laptop.

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
The Co—Star app's purpose is to deepen users' knowledge of their own astrological identity, as well as establish and strengthen their relationships with people in their lives who share their interest in astrology. In regards to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, this purpose or activity speaks to a human's need to feel like they belong and the need to maintain and nurture one's own self-esteem. These are very broad and expansive needs, so it makes sense that there are many different approaches to this. For one, to some extent, one must believe in the ideologies behind astrology in order to be willing to partake and use an app like Co—Star. By that logic, a user on the Co—Star app can only begin to build and/or join a community on the app if they know people who share that belief.
