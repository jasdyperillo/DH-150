## Introduction
The Co—Star app provides users with insight into their astrological identity through daily in-depth horoscopes. It also serves as a platform for users to interact with friends by offering compatibility evaluations based on their birth/natal charts.  

A usability test is designed to identify a website or app's functionality through the user's ability to easily navigate and operate the website/app. It can be conducted in several ways, but generally, participants in a usability test are instructed to complete a number of tasks to the best of their ability. The participants' responses are then documented.

I conducted a usability test using a screen recording of the user's iPhone while they completed the tasks on the app. I also documented the participant by using ActivePresenter, which records a laptop's screen with the audio and visuals of the person using the laptop.
