## Introduction
The Co—Star app provides users with insight into their astrological identity through daily in-depth horoscopes. It also serves as a platform for users to interact with friends by offering compatibility evaluations based on their birth/natal charts.  

A usability test is designed to identify a website or app's functionality through the user's ability to easily navigate and operate the website/app. It can be conducted in several ways, but generally, participants in a usability test are instructed to complete a number of tasks to the best of their ability. The participants' responses are then documented.

I conducted a usability test using a screen recording of the user's iPhone while they completed the tasks on the app. I also documented the participant by using ActivePresenter, which records a laptop's screen with the audio and visuals of the person using the laptop.


## Methodology

I asked a friend to participate in a usability test for the Co—Star app. The session with the participant lasted approximately 23 minutes. During the session and as part of the usability test, I (as the moderator/test administrator) asked the participant to fill out a Google Form questionnaire (see Survey Link). 

Participants read the task scenarios and tried to find the information and navigate using the app.

After the last task was completed, the test administrator asked the participant to rate the difficulty of the first task and their agreeability with listed statements using a 7-point Likert scale. The participant was also asked to select 5 phrases that indicate or reflect most accurately of their experience and impression of the app's interface.

## Reflection

I think the biggest takeaway was how important it is for an app or website to have an intuitive design and interface. I actually had to conduct two usability tests because the first one did not go well. My first participant accidentally deleted their screen recording which had documented how they used the app, and there were also some kinks in the survey that I only noticed after the first usability test. Overall, even though this usability test has room for improvement, I've already gained so much insight into how this app could be improved. In the future, I think I would like to incorporate sections in the survey where participants can enter in comments if they have anything they'd like to add.
